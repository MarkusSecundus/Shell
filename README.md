# Shell

Basic linux shell created for semestral work for [Unix/Linux Programming in C](https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c) at MFF CUNI

Among others relies on the [readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library and lexer + parser generators [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex/) & [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
